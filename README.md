## Project Preface: Amazon Keywords-Search Terms
### What: I will be taking 18 keywords that you can type into the amazon search bar at amazon.com. These 18 keywords represent physical products that can be purchased from their website. From there, I will be evaluating the search results products pages under that key term. I will be collecting  my own data on each term via junglescout. Keywords symbolize physical products that can be bought on amazon. 
### Attributes: For each keyword the attritube we will using to analyze each search term is 
* Product Name: The individual name under the keyword of the product 
* Brand: Individual Product brand for the keyword
* Monthly Sales: The total monthly sales that keyword recieves across a varyety of product listings
